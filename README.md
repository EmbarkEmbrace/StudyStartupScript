<h1>Study Startup Script</h1>

<h2>What It Does:</h2> - This script launches two web browsers with specific URLs, as well as VS Code.
<h2>Purpose:</h2> - The puprpose of this script is to make it easy to setup my local environment for studying. As a daily task, it gets old having to manually open certain programs, URLs, etc; therefore, I decided  to create a simple script that enabled me to generate these needs with a simple click of the button.

<h2>Tech Used:</h2> - Python

<h2>How It Works:</h2> - The script import both the "webbrowser," and "os" modules. It then runs through a function called "getStarted." This function opens three URLs within your browser (In Script: Replit, Udemy, and Github), and then proceeds to open Visual Studio Code.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2> - How to utilize both the "webbrowser" and "os" modules to make studying easier.

<h2>Notes:</h2> - It's worth mentioning that if you isntall pyinstaller, you can actually create an executable that launches the script.
